# Evaluating Human Capital--finding databases on continuing vocational training (CVT)

In Abrahamâ€™s article, I found some indication of databases that could support using the cost approach to analyze human capital. National accounting experts working on measuring nonmarket output, such as government services, generally recommend using a quantity index to separate nominal spending changes into real output growth versus price changes (European Commission et al. 2009; UNECE 2016). For education, the main challenge lies in constructing a quantity index of real output that can be consistently tracked over time.

Following my LitMap last week, I tracked the citation to the UNECE (2016) guide, Measuring Human Capital, published by the UNECE. This guide provides a comprehensive introduction to methods for measuring human capital and includes a very helpful section on recommended databases related to education and training expenditures, suitable for conducting a cost-approach analysis. It directs me to the Eurostat database, which covers multiple topics I could work on. Among all the recommendations, I am most interested in the costs of foregone work during training. This topic connects both the education track and the corporate track I discussed two weeks ago. The guide also summarizes important trends in the cost of foregone work: from 1987 to 1998, these costs generally decreased slowly over time. After 1998, the share of costs of forgone education steadily increased, reaching 47 percent in 2005. The reasons behind this trend can be further investigated and may or may not form the basis of a research topic.

The next step is to take a closer look at what the Eurostat database offers. There is a large section on continuing vocational training (CVT), which includes a wide range of data: CVT strategies (type of planning, type of training, class size, etc.); enterprises providing training by type of training and size class; enterprises with or without staff representatives involved in CVT management by type of involvement and NACE Rev. 2 activity; usual reaction to future skill needs by type of reaction and size class; participants in CVT courses by sex and size class; costs of CVT courses by type and size class; hours spent in CVT courses by size class; characteristics of CVT courses, including the main skills targeted by type of skill; and assessment of CVT training, such as enterprises that evaluate the outcomes of CVT activities. There are many potential topics to explore in this dataset.

I then started to look at exisitng research that uses this set of data base. One of the essays I found is _Obstacles to Employer-Provided Training in Europe: Determinants and Policy Implications_ by Giorgio Brunello and Patricia Wruuck. The essay finds significant differences of CVT training across Europe, with Western and Northern firms offering more training than Southern and CESEE firms, and while training incidence has risen since 2005, gaps between countries persist. Firm-level factors such as financial constraints limit training investment, while country-level factors like economic growth, R&D intensity, educated labor, and product market competition positively influence training. Employment protection and temporary contracts can reduce training provision. Overall, there is no single solution to increase firm training, and policy interventions should target financing constraints and externalities while avoiding subsidies for training that would have occurred anyway. I will find more readings next week and select a specific research questions through this databases and more exisiting research.
