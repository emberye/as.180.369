In Abrahamâ€™s article, I found some indication of databases that could support using the cost approach to analyze human capital. National accounting experts working on measuring nonmarket output, such as government services, generally recommend using a quantity index to separate nominal spending changes into real output growth versus price changes (European Commission et al. 2009; UNECE 2016). For education, the main challenge lies in constructing a quantity index of real output that can be consistently tracked over time.

Following my LitMap last week, I tracked the citation to the UNECE (2016) guide, Measuring Human Capital, published by the UNECE. This guide provides a comprehensive introduction to methods for measuring human capital and includes a very helpful section on recommended databases related to education and training expenditures, suitable for conducting a cost-approach analysis. It directs me to the Eurostat database, which covers multiple topics I could work on. Among all the recommendations, I am most interested in the costs of foregone work during training. This topic connects both the education track and the corporate track I discussed two weeks ago. The guide also summarizes important trends in the cost of foregone work: from 1987 to 1998, these costs generally decreased slowly over time. After 1998, the share of costs of forgone education steadily increased, reaching 47 percent in 2005. The reasons behind this trend can be further investigated and may or may not form the basis of a research topic.
