    "Given the available data for 2015 and 2020, the proposed research focuses on examining whether vocational training investment served as a buffer during the COVID-19 shock. While post-2020 recovery data are not available, it is still possible to assess shock resilience by analyzing whether countries with higher pre-pandemic vocational training expenditures experienced smaller GDP declines in 2020. In this framework, the x-variable represents the vocational training cost per employee in 2015 (or 2020, if more recent pre-pandemic data are available), while the y-variable measures GDP decline in 2020, calculated as the percentage change relative to the previous year. This approach allows the study to capture whether higher training levels contributed to countriesâ€™ ability to withstand sudden economic shocks."

    "To apply the Fechner correlation coefficient, GDP declines are transformed into a measure of resilience, where higher values indicate smaller losses or better shock absorption. The sign-based Fechner methodology then evaluates whether countries with above-average training investment tend to align with above-average resilience, and conversely, whether countries with below-average training correspond to below-average resilience. A positive Fechner correlation would indicate that pre-pandemic training investments were generally associated with better economic shock absorption, while a negative correlation would suggest the opposite."

    "This analysis provides a robust, cross-country perspective on the role of vocational training in macroeconomic stability during a crisis. By focusing on directional co-movement rather than the magnitude of effects, the study accounts for structural differences among countries, such as population size, wage levels, and economic maturity, which could distort traditional regression analyses. In this way, the research can offer insights into the potential of workforce development policies to enhance economic resilience in the face of large-scale shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic."
