# Research Method: the Cost Appraoch of evaluating Human Capital

Instead of selecting a broad topic within human capital, my focus this week has been on the classical models for evaluating it. Abraham identifies three main approaches: the Indicator, the Cost, and the Income models. The Indicator approach uses measures such as years of schooling, literacy, test scores, or survival rates as proxies for a nation’s stock of human capital. These are usually drawn from censuses, surveys, or administrative records. Its advantage is that it is straightforward and relatively easy to explain, but the choice and weighting of indicators can be arbitrary and may not capture true educational quality. The Cost approach values human capital as the sum of investments made—direct spending on education, training, or health, plus the value of unpaid time like study hours. It fits neatly into national accounts and provides monetary comparability with other types of capital, but results can vary depending on assumptions about depreciation and how to value unpaid time. Finally, the Income approach estimates the present value of future labor income, essentially treating human capital as the discounted stream of expected lifetime earnings. While powerful and widely used (e.g., in Jorgenson’s models), it is highly sensitive to assumptions about wage growth, discount rates, and incomplete schooling. In addition, Liu and Fraumeni’s NBER Working Paper No. 27561, A Brief Introduction to Human Capital Measures (2020) expands on the Indicator method by cataloging six major index-based or monetary measures of human capital that cover more than 130 countries, offering a broader landscape of available datasets for researchers.

My plan is to use the cost approach because it is easier to find data for analysis. The indicator model requires surveys and census data, which is probably not feasible for the scope of this paper. The income method focuses heavily on modeling and projection, which is also difficult. Therefore, I might focus on the cost approach. The next step will be to identify around five key studies from the past that have used the cost approach. In this process, I hope to find a suitable database. Essentially, I will be narrowing my topic based on the availability of data and methods, rather than just on my interests.
